# 🚀 Django Boilerplate

Welcome to the Django Boilerplate project! This template provides a solid foundation for your Django projects, complete with a convenient setup script and essential configurations.

## 🌟 Features

- 📁 Pre-configured project structure
- 🐳 Docker support
- 🛠 VS Code settings
- 📝 Customized `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`
- 🔧 Makefile for common operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

Getting started with this Django Boilerplate is as easy as running a single command! Choose the appropriate command for your operating system:

### 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS

```bash
curl -sSL https://l.ayushb.com/django | bash
```

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr https://l.ayushb.com/django | iex
```

This command will:
1. Download the setup script
2. Execute the script, which will:
   - Create necessary directories
   - Download configuration files
   - Set up your Django project structure

## 📁 Project Structure

After running the setup script, your project structure will look like this:

```
your-project/
├── .vscode/
│   ├── .gitignore
│   └── settings.json
├── .gitignore
├── .dockerignore
├── Dockerfile
└── Makefile
```

## 🛠 Customization
